# Adaptive Learning Pathways

## Description

This project is an AI-driven educational system that personalizes learning experiences using machine learning and reinforcement learning. It adapts learning pathways for students based on their learning styles, performance, and progress. The project is inspired by the research paper *"Optimization of Personalized Learning Pathways Based on Competencies and Outcome"* (Jianhua Lin, IEEE 2016).
